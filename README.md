# Smart-City
An IoT Project for PGC National Robotics Exhibition 2024 by Team RWP/ISB

This prohect took a lot of time. When I say a lot, it mean a lot. Nothing too complicated it was very simple and straight forward solution to many issues of the socities. We built mobile apps for 3 buildings Home, College, and Hospital. We can control doors, fans, and lights with mobile app. We created the mobile app using the Blynk IoT platform. Automatic Adhaan, Automatic Street lights, Smart energy solution using solar panels, and Smart Parking systems were some other features. For complete information about the project, please have a look at the attached document.

"Smart City" project is an innovative application of IoT technology aimed at transforming urban infrastructure and enhancing the quality of life for residents through automation and real-time data collection. It incorporates a wide range of smart systems across various sectors. For instance, the hospital module includes features such as automatic lifts that detect the presence of individuals using IR sensors, a smart CT scanner, and a drip monitoring system that alerts staff when a drip is empty, ensuring patient care efficiency. Automatic doors and mobile-controlled lighting systems managed through the Blynk IoT platform further enhance hospital functionality. The smart home system offers advanced control of lights, fans, and a rain detection system that automatically activates to protect the homeâ€™s roof. Air quality sensors trigger exhaust fans and emergency alarms when pollutant levels exceed safe limits, while access to the home is secured via RFID scanning. Additionally, the smart mosque module automates the Adhan (call to prayer) by utilizing a microcontroller to activate a speaker at prayer times, although this feature requires approval due to its religious significance. The project also introduces a smart parking system with barriers controlled by IR sensors that open when a car is detected, alongside an LED system that indicates whether parking spaces are available. Smart streetlights equipped with LDR sensors automatically adjust to the time of day, turning on at night and off in the morning. Other features of the project include a smart park with solar-powered charging ports, automated systems in commercial buildings, and a clock tower that provides timekeeping. By connecting all these systems through IoT technology, the project illustrates how urban environments can become more efficient, sustainable, and responsive to real-time data, contributing to enhanced safety, convenience, and resource management for city inhabitants.
